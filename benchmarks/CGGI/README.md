## Benchmarking of CGGI Bootstrapping Algorithm

> The benchmarks have been run on a commodity desktop with a 12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-1235U, 1300 Mhz and 16 GB of RAM, running Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS.

### CGGI single-bit

We ran the benchmarks for CGGI (Chillotti-Gama-Georgieva-Izabachene) bootstrapping algorithm (with 1 bit precision) given in the openFHE library for c++ using the source file `binfhe-ginx.cpp`.

No. of slots: 1

bits of precision: 1-bit
